Find all the domains and the subdomain. Use online tools like Censys and crt.sh
Also use tools like sublist3r.py

Use whois to get the provider(eg, AWS, GOOGLE, etc)

Run nmap on all the domain we got
nmap -F -sV -iL domains.txt -oA results

Look for CNAME domain names
getent hosts test.example.com
